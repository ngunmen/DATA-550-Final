OCD Patients DATA 550 Final



## Data 
- `data/` contains the dataset for the project
- `code/` will contain codes that produces tables and plots
- `output/` will contain output that successfully run 


## Initial Code Description
`data/load_ocddata.R`
- Run all the codes in this Rscript to load the data.

`code/01_make_output.R`
- Generates the table that provides insights into the education level, and marital status, reported by individuals of different ethnicities within the OCD patient dataset
- Run all the codes in this script 
- Generates the required figure using `gtsummary`
- Saves the table as `.rds` object in the `output/` folder
- Check in `output/` to ensure that the tables/graphs are saved


`code/02_make_output.R`
- Analyzes the relationship between demographic factors, duration of symptoms, OCD types, and severity
- Generates the required figure using `ggplot2`
- Renders the final report using `report.Rmd`
- Check in `output/` to ensure that the tables/graphs are saved

## Output Directory

- `Demographics_Table.csv`: This file contains the table that provides insights into the marital status and education level reported by individuals of different ethnicities within the OCD patient dataset, generated by `code/01_make_output.R`.

- `gplot_data.png`: This file contains the figure that visualizes the relationship between demographic factors, duration of symptoms and genders `code/02_make_output.R`.

- `obsession_severity.png`: This file contains the figure that visualizes the relationship between obsession type and Obsession Severity Score `code/02_make_output.R`.

- `compulsion_severity.png`: This file contains the figure that visualizes the relationship between compulsion type and Compulsion Severity Score `code/02_make_output.R`.

- `obsession_duration.png`: This file contains the figure that visualizes the relationship between obsession type and Obsession duration `code/02_make_output.R`.

- `compulsion_duration.png`: This file contains the figure that visualizes the relationship between compulsion type and compulsion duration `code/02_make_output.R`.


`report.Rmd`
- Reads the tables and figures generated by `code/01_make_output.R` and `code/02_make_output.R`
- Integrates the analysis, tables, and figures into the final report
- run all the codes and save the file
- reproduce the report using `make` command on terminal
